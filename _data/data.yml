      - title: Apparatus for detecting moment described by sentence query in video and method using the same
        link: "#"
        authors: Jin-Young Moon, SHIN Jung-Kyoo, Hyung-il Kim
        conference: 2022
    intro : Disclosed herein are an apparatus for detecting a moment described by a sentence query in a video and a method using the same. A method for detecting a moment described by a sentence query in a video includes dividing an input video into units of chunks and generating a chunk-level feature sequence based on features that are extracted in a form of vectors from respective chunks, dividing an input sentence query into units of words and generating a sentence-level feature sequence based on features that are extracted in a form of vectors from respective words, generating a chunk-sentence relation feature sequence including contextual information of the video by extracting a relation between the chunk-level feature sequence and the sentence-level feature sequence, and estimating a temporal interval corresponding to the sentence query in the video based on the chunk-sentence relation feature sequence.
